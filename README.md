# LiveFront Challenge #

I attempted to create some ui test as discussed but i dont think i had enough time to really get a good hold on using espresso and ui tests in general as i have only ever written one in the past.
Given more time i would have like to:

     * Handle no internet
     * Write documentation
     * Add swipe to refresh
     * More Unit and UI tests
     * Cache responses on the search screen
     * Night mode
     * Creates some shared styles
     * Better design and colors


This was a rather simple project so i am also attaching the apk for another interview coding challenge that i am working on that i beleive displays a lot more understanding of android development. Code for that project will
be up on my github tomorrow once i am finished with it. In addition to what the LiveFront coding challenge requested this one has use of jetpack navigation, nested recyclerviews, bottomnavigationview and more.
